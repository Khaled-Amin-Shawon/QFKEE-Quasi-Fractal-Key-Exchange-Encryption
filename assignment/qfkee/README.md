# QFKEE: Quasi-Fractal Key Exchange Encryption - Full Python Implementation

This repository provides a complete, ready-to-use Python implementation of the QFKEE (Quasi-Fractal Key Exchange Encryption) algorithm. QFKEE is a post-quantum cryptographic scheme that utilizes chaotic fractal sequences and quasi-prime construction to generate high-entropy, quantum-resistant keys. The implementation includes all essential cryptographic steps: key generation, encryption, decryption, and a simple GUI for demonstration.

## üìù Algorithm Overview

QFKEE combines the following cryptographic primitives:
- **Chaotic Map (Logistic Map):** Generates pseudo-random sequences for mask and key material.
- **Quasi-Prime Construction:** Ensures high entropy and unpredictability in key generation.
- **SHA-512 Hashing:** Derives the final key from chaotic and quasi-prime data.
- **XOR Block Cipher:** Lightweight encryption using block-wise XOR with chaotic masks.
- **Permutation:** Adds diffusion by permuting cipher blocks.
